# Retinal Disease Detection Expert System

This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid expert system for
automated detection and grading of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using retinal
fundus images.

## Project Overview
The system integrates:
- A Convolutional Neural Network (EfficientNet-B0) for deep feature extraction
- Handcrafted retinal features for clinical interpretability
- A meta-learner for feature fusion
- A rule-based reasoning layer aligned with ophthalmological standards

## Dataset
APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset (Kaggle)
